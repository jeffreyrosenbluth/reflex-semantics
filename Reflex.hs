-- Reflex FRP
------------------------------------------------------------------
-- The denotational semantics of Reflex FRP
-- using notation similar to that in FRPNow,
-- http://www.cse.chalmers.se/~atze/papers/prprfrp.pdf, since
-- it is the closest thing I have seen to haskell.

-- We take (=) to indicate semantic equality.
-- In other words, the left hand side of an equals sign is haskell and
-- the right hand side is math.
