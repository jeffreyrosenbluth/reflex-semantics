-- Events must satifsy the constraint that for any two Times s < t, the
-- number of Just values in the interval (s, t) is finite. I
-- believe that somehting like this is technically necessary in
-- the semantics of Push-Pull FRP as well.

-- This representation of Events does however, restrict two Events from
-- occuring at the same time. However, we can gain back the full generality by
-- this using the merge function which, unlike the Push-Pull FRP semantics,
-- keeps These values of simultaneous events.
