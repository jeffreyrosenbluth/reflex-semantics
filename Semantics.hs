-- Begin work on the denotational semantics of Reflex FRP.
-- 1. Write the denotational semantics of Conal's Push-Pull FRP
--    using notation similar to that in FRPNow,
--    http://www.cse.chalmers.se/~atze/papers/prprfrp.pdf, since
--    it is the closest thing I have seen to haskell.
-- 2. Use this notation to write down the denotational semantics of reflex.
-- 3. Compare the two, showing why reflex is a valid FRP and point out the
--    differences.

-- We take (=) to indicate semantic equality.
-- In other words, the left hand side of an equals sign is haskell and
-- the right hand side is math.
